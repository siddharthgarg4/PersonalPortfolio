# PersonalPortfolio

## Project Description

This website was built to showcase myself and the projects that I have worked on.

## Inspiration 

Pursuing co-op in my academic program, I regularly have to apply to jobs and look for opportunities. This felt like the perfect complement to a resume.

## How I built it

**Figma** - Wireframing for UI/UX

**Vue JS** - Framework (TypeScript, HTML, SCSS)

**Bootstrap 4** - Styling library 


## Challenges I ran into

**Fonts** - using font face and locally stored fonts

**Deployment** - deploying the website on Github Pages
