    "description": "I am currently a 4th year student pursuing a dual degree in Computer Science and Business at the University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University respectively.\n\nAt my previous internships, I was given the opportunity to explore the field of mobile and backend development in a collaborative and fast paced environment. These opportunities have allowed me to refine my leadership and technical skills while working on a product currently in market.\n\nAs a software engineer, I am constantly looking for new challenges to push me outside my comfort zone, as I believe that we stop growing once we are unwilling to have new experiences.\n\nOutside of school and work, I love exploring new cities, going on unplanned adventures, watching soccer and trying new food.
